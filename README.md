## Analyzing Presidential Debates Using Natural Language Processing
## *Metis Project 4*
## By: Patrick Bovard

### PROJECT IN PROGRESS

**Project Description:** 
The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to better understand how presidential debates in the United States have evolved over time.  Going into the project, major questions to be explored were:  
1. How have debates changed over time?
2. Do parties or moderators tend to focus on certain topics?  Have these changed?
3. Do election winners and losers have patterns in their sentiment or topics?

**Data Sources:** Data has been scraped using BeautifulSoup from the following sites for this project:  
- [Commission for Presidential Debates:](https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/) used for official transcripts on the General Election Debates, 1960-present  
-  [The American President Project from UC Santa Barbara:](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-documents-archive-guidebook/presidential-campaigns-debates-and-endorsements-0) used for transcripts of primary debates for Republican and Democrat candidates, 2000-present  

**Tools Used:**  
- Webscraping: BeautifulSoup
- Data Analysis and Model Building: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
- Natural Language Processing: TF-IDF Vectorization, Topic Modeling via NMF

**Navigating the Repo:**
- Data folder: houses data generated throughout this progress in .pickle format
